# Decisions Log

Per-sprint, append-only. Never edited or removed. Created at `scope`, rotated at phase entry (`.asd/rules/artifact-layout.md` "Decisions log"), archived with the sprint.

## Entry format

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — <one-line summary>

- **Decision**: <what was decided> (≤3 sentences)
- **Rationale**: <why> (≤3 sentences)
- **Affected docs**: <links> (unrestricted)
```

A no-op skip, other zero-content decision, dispatch routing line or failed-dispatch reconstruction uses the one-line form instead:

```markdown
- YYYY-MM-DD — <phase> skipped: <reason>
- YYYY-MM-DD — route <taskIds>: <tier>, dispatch HEAD <sha>
- YYYY-MM-DD — reconstruction: landed <ids>; re-dispatched <ids>
```

## Durability rule

A decision whose value must survive this sprint's archival is ALSO written into an existing persistent home — a `docs/` fold target, `CHANGELOG.md`, or `.asd/project/stubs.md`. Never invent a new document type for this. This log records that the decision was made; the persistent home is what a later sprint can still read.

## 2026-09-16 — impl-review iter-02: route to impl review-fix

- **Decision**: correctness (COR-1), testing (TST-1), documentation (DOC-1) CONCERNS; external APPROVE (latched at 2); efficiency inherited APPROVE (latched). `review_fixes_pending = iter-02`.
- **Rationale**: No FAIL; iteration 3 within high budget. Correctness's out-of-surface remark on an empty `decisions-log.005.md` checked and false: `.005` holds the impl-test entry 2 lines.
- **Affected docs**: [reviews/impl/iter-02/](reviews/impl/iter-02/)
