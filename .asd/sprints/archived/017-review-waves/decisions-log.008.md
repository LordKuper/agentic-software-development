# Decisions Log

Per-sprint, append-only. Never edited or removed. Created at `scope`, rotated at phase entry (`.asd/rules/artifact-layout.md` "Decisions log"), archived with the sprint.

## Entry format

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — <one-line summary>

- **Decision**: <what was decided> (≤3 sentences)
- **Rationale**: <why> (≤3 sentences)
- **Affected docs**: <links> (unrestricted)
```

A no-op skip, other zero-content decision, dispatch routing line or failed-dispatch reconstruction uses the one-line form instead:

```markdown
- YYYY-MM-DD — <phase> skipped: <reason>
- YYYY-MM-DD — route <taskIds>: <tier>, dispatch HEAD <sha>
- YYYY-MM-DD — reconstruction: landed <ids>; re-dispatched <ids>
```

## Durability rule

A decision whose value must survive this sprint's archival is ALSO written into an existing persistent home — a `docs/` fold target, `CHANGELOG.md`, or `.asd/project/stubs.md`. Never invent a new document type for this. This log records that the decision was made; the persistent home is what a later sprint can still read.
